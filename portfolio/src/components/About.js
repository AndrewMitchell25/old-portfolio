                    <p>Hi! I'm Andrew Mitchell!</p>  
                    <p>I am an undergraduate student at the University of Notre Dame,
                        currently studying to get a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computer Engineering. I have been 
                        programming in some form or another since 5th grade and it has become a passion of mine. I am
                        always searching for new things to learn, and I enjoy proplem-solving.
